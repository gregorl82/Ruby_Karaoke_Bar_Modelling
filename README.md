<h1>Ruby Karaoke Bar Modelling</h1>
<p>You have been approached to build software for a Karaoke bar. Specifically, they want you to build a software for checking guests in and out, plus handling songs.</p>
<p>Your program should be test driven and should be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create rooms, songs and guests</li>
<li>Check in guests to rooms/Check out guests from rooms</li>
<li>Add songs to rooms</li>
</ul>
<h2>Extensions</h2>
<ul>
<li>What happens if there are more guests trying to be checked in than there is free space in the room?</li>
<li>Karaoke venues usually have an entry fee - So the guests could have money so they can pay it.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Advanced extensions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Guests could have a favourite song, and if their favourite song is on the room’s playlist, they can cheer loudly! (return a string like “Whoo!”)</li>
<li>Rooms can keep track of the entry fees/spending of the guests - maybe add a bar tab/bar class?</li>
</ul>
